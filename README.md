# What is this?

This repository helps students at Malmö högskola to get started with Git and GitHub. It includes a [Git and GitHub guide](https://fhall.github.io/da336a/) and material for laborating with Git and GitHub.

## Thank you

[The guide](https://fhall.github.io/da336a/) uses [Poole and Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) for generating the GitHub pages.

# Steps

## Installing Git

First things first. Depending on your environment you might not have Git installed. If you have Mac OS X or Linux as your operating system you probably already have it installed. If you have Windows (and haven't worked with Git before) you probably haven't. Make sure that you have it installed or head over to [the Git website](http://www.git-scm.com/), download and install it.

Next thing you need too do is too make a choice. When working with Git you can work with the command line or with a graphical client. If you want to work in the command line there are some commands you have to learn.
