# Steps

## Installing Git

First things first. Depending on your environment you might not have Git installed. If you have Mac OS X or Linux as your operating system you probably already have it installed. If you have Windows (and haven't worked with Git before) you probably haven't. Anyway too work with Git you need too have it installed (duh!). Make sure that you have it installed or head over to [the Git website](http://www.git-scm.com/), download and install it.

The second thing you need too do is too make a choice. When working with Git you can work with the command line or with a graphical client.
